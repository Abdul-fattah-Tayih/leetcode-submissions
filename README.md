# LeetCode Submissions
This repository contains all my solutions to the leetcode problems I've solved, I mainly use this to revise, but if this helps you then even better!

## Structure
There's no real structure to this project (so far), just dumping a bunch `.py` files in the root directory, however I think I'll have to organize the problems by their pattern or general topic sooner or later

## Misc
- Some files contain more than 1 solution, usually a naive/brute force approach and a more efficient solution.
- I try to be as concise as possible when explaining the solution, but if you find anything confusing please let me know!
